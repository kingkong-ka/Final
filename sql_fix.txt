In behavior.blade.php, replace all instances of:

->distinct('student_id')
->count('student_id');

with:

->distinct('violations.student_id')
->count('violations.student_id');

This will fix the "Integrity constraint violation: 1052 Column 'student_id' in field list is ambiguous" error by specifying which table the student_id column belongs to.
